Our idea is about using Machine Learning to analyse spending patterns of the users and summarize it into a financial rating that gives a baseline for financial goodness.

Implementation:

1st - a sykitlearn machine learning model which gives abour 72% accuracy on the training dataset
run the "hackbash.ipynb" file for it.

2nd - a AUTOAI model "Final Model - P7 notebook.ipynb" and it's api call in "Auto AI Prediction.py" this approach was discarded because of poor performance on the testing dataset.

half done implementation of the web app has also been added "web app.py" with the Training and Testing Dataset aswell.
